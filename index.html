            <p>The role the media plays when it comes to politics and government has always been a complicated one. "At the end of the twentieth century, nearly nine out of 10 journalists believed the press 'keeps political leaders from doing things they shouldn't ,'" said Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel in "The Elements of Journalism" (2014, pg. 173). Media as a watchdog of the government is an older concept, since the days of Watergate and the Vietnam War, and it is a widely accepted one. But how should the media cover politicians? Electing the leader of our country is perhaps one of the biggest decisions and responsibilities that Americans have as citizens of this country. Should the media have a certain method of covering political races that varies from the standard journalistic values? More broadly, what kind of role should media have when it comes to covering presidential elections?</p>

          <div class="seven columns text">
            <p>This is a question nobody has a concrete answer to and creates many ethical dilemmas. As <span class="bold red">Bernard L. Fraga,</span> an Assistant Professor in Political Science at Indiana University, said America has a way of conducting an election that is unique to the rest of the world (personal communication, October 27, 2015). "Other countries run elections very differently... in other countries, there's many more restrictions on the media. There are few restrictions that we have ... but you know for the most part it's pretty unregulated," Fraga said. Our media does have regulations when it comes to political coverage; there is the equal-time provision, for example, but our Constitution guarantees freedom of the press for the most part like Fraga has pointed out. Since the days of the Federalist Papers, people believed "citizens had an obligation to read such information [unfettered communication]; the press had an obligation to provide it" (Patterson &amp; Wilkins, 2104, pg. 131). But how should the media provide this information and how do they decide what information is needed?</p>
          
            <p>Today's coverage of presidential elections tends to focus on polls, the candidates' personalities, who's leading, strategy and tactics, and it tends to be mostly negative (Patterson &amp; Wilkins, 2014, pg. 134). This doesn't sound like providing citizens with unfettered information about candidates and their stand on the issues, which is arguably what should matter the most (what will they do for this country and how do they plan on doing that?). We see the phenomenon of "horse-race journalism." According to Fraga, who teaches on the subject, the comparison comes from the fact that in a horse race, the coverage "doesn't predict very well, the end result could be radically different from how things start," just in like a horse race (personal communication, October 27, 2015). Fraga claims this is because "the media is a business first and foremost" and "they wouldn't do it if it doesn't work" in regards to boosting readership. But, if that's true, then one must question where this leaves our journalistic values, primarily the one of loyalty, loyalty to our readership instead of the "business" of journalism.</p>
            
            <p>Fraga doesn't think horse-race journalism is bias; rather it is a business strategy (personal communication, October 27, 2015). He refers to the way media works; that the media is only reflecting what the citizens want to hear. He said "we kind of have ourselves to blame if that's what they're doing, they wouldn't do it if it didn't work and if we wanted something else we would see it" (personal communication, October 27, 2015). But, this goes against the theory of social responsibility: the media should be providing us with all the information necessary to make educated decisions, not what we want to hear, ideally anyway according to Patterson and Wilkins (2015, pg. 131).</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold red">Julia Fox</span> an Assistant Professor at the Indiana University Media School, said she believes "there’s agenda setting, of course, of whatever topics the media cover tend to be whatever we think are the most important topics" (personal communication, October 23, 2015). But to Fox, this doesn't allow us to deduce that the media changes our mind but rather "primes our preexisting attitudes that we may already have." This is connected to the idea of framing, how certain news stories are framed by the media, which does influence how we look at certain news stories. Again, ideally, the information should be unfettered, unbiased, but could the media have a responsibility to frame stories in certain ways to inform citizens on the important issues. When you step into that realm, now it must be considered who decides what is important and what authority they have.</p>
           
            <p>Fox also echoed Fraga's view that the media is giving the people what they want. "I mean, media is driving interest stories, that’s why we are seeing all the coverage about Trump and to a lesser extent, Carson," Fox said.</p>
            
            <p>Another issue that arises in media coverage of elections is the fact that most people tend to get their political information from advertising, rather than a news source (Patterson &amp; Wilkins, 2014, pg. 134). In a study titled "The Mass Media and the Public's Assessment of Presidential Candidates," which looked at examples from 1952 to 2000, it found there was a shift in how citizens gathered information about candidates and that "the vast sums that are currently spent on presidential campaign ads are, we believe, beneficial to a public that has other priorities than political self-education" (Gilens et al., 2007). This puts us into the ethical dilemmas that advertisements pose — Are they truthful? Do they respect their audience? Are they factual and rational? Advertising costs money, and so it is easy to deduce that whoever has the most money will be heard the most (Patterson &amp; Wilkins, 2014, pg. 136).</p>
            
            <p>The citizen's role in all of this must also be considered. Should citizens be expected to seek out full, unfettered information on their own? Fraga said the reason many citizens are "relatively uninformed" could be because they are "busy with other things to do." Fox used the example of the Benghazi trial. Since it was broadcast live, citizens could have easily recorded it and watched it for themselves. But like Fraga said, not many people have time to watch 11 hours of footage. And so people turn to the media. With all the information available today, citizens must decide for themselves which information is politically relevant. Citizens can use tests to figure this out, such as the ones developed by political scientist Bruce A. Williams (Patterson &amp; Wilkins, 2014, pg. 132).</p>
            
            <p>Finally, one of the biggest questions in today's media coverage of presidential elections is the treatment of front-runners versus the rest of the candidates. Consumers see this time and time again — articles will mention the two or three front-runners, spend time explaining the deal with each of them, and then lump the rest of the candidates together into a couple of sentences. TV-friendly candidates get the most coverage (Patterson &amp; Wilkins, 2014, pg. 137). Is this fair and should the media change this?</p>
            
            <p>To Fox and Fraga it seems that the media has less responsibility in all of this than the citizens do. Yet, our textbooks and journalistic principles tell us that it is the media who must inform the public and present a clear, balanced view of the events that occur. The ethical dilemmas that arise from covering presidential races are numerous and it will be interesting to see if any of the usual methods for covering presidential races will change as we near the November election next year.</p>

              <p class="sidebar head">On race and the media</p>
              <p class="sidebar">"Some of my work would suggest that party identification, affinity for one party of another, can supersede someone's racial or ethnic identity or gender identity, party matters a lot, a little bit of what you're seeing here is republican party voters many of whom are non-Hispanic white are willing to at least in this case right now support Ben Carson who's African American. Race matters a lot in elections, but party can supersede that in certain instances, which is an interesting dynamic."</p>
              <p class="sidebar head">On horse-race journalism</p>
              <p class="sidebar">"That phenomenon of horse-race journalism is something that we've seen quite a bit of in the media for a long time, why does it exist? Is it a bias by the media? They wouldn't do it if it doesn't work. One of the things that I talk about in my class, this is not something I make up this is something people do research on and understand in political science, the media is a business first and foremost. We've seen tremendous declines in newspaper subscriptions, it is transforming the way media is interacted with. Now what we call something like clickbait, before was horse race journalism, the media wants to grab people's attention and keep it for revenue purposes, for advertising purposes, etc."</p>
              <p class="sidebar">"So we kind of have ourselves to blame if that's what they're doing, like they wouldn't do it if it didn't work and if we wanted something else we would see it. Well, is the media biasing or influencing the election? Well, they're only reflecting what we want to hear, what we want to see."</p>
              <p class="sidebar head">On media’s obligation to keep the electorate informed</p>
              <p class="sidebar">"But who defines what you need to be informed? That's the issue. You know, who describes that? Who decides it, that's the big question. As far as we can tell the only answer that seems satisfactory is you decide. The individual decides and they choose to consume the information they want or they don't, I mean that's a tricky state of the world to be in right? A tricky situation because you say well it's kind of incumbent on us citizens to make demands if we want change but that's politics, that's the point, if we don't like our leaders, kick them out, go vote, but a lot of people don't, so does that mean they're satisfied? I don't know I mean we don't have ... we're not gonna force people."</p>

              <p class="sidebar head">On the current state of the election</p>
              <p class="sidebar">"Different candidates have their sort of moments with the party when they were like the ‘darling of the party’ and then they went away. So i think the media, a lot of people initially with Donald Trump were thinking, calling it the ‘summer of Trump,’ that it was a flash in the pan, that he’s the one people know, the TV personality, shoots from the hip, well he has now been on top of every leading national poll for over 100 days. So whatever is going on it can’t be explained away that easily. So I think there has been an emphasis as you say on the sporting event of the polls because it has been kind of unbelievable that the expected frontrunners are either trailing so badly or already dropped out."</p>
              <p class="sidebar head">On Benghazi hearing coverage</p>
              <p class="sidebar">"So if you look at the Benghazi, the special hearing, the coverage going into and coming out, a lot of the framing has been on whether or not this is political exercise with the aim of hurting Hillary Clinton’s chances in the presidential election, like I brought in today just as an example here’s a USA Today, if you read the coverage of this trial, almost every paragraph is framed in terms of was this politically motivated. Even the quotes from Republicans, saying ‘no this isn’t politically motivated’ is working within that frame. There’s literally one paragraph that I noticed that talked about what impact this might have for her. This is a long article, it’s a half-page article (okay some big pictures, but) and there’s not much about there was eleven hours of testimony? Many many hours, and this is what we are getting. And that can influence people. That’s emphasizing our response. That emphasis influences our response. Because now we are thinking about is this politically motivated? Is this going to hurt her chances, is this going to help her chances? And not what did we learn about this terrorist attack, and how can we hopefully prevent another one from happening?"</p>

            <p>The ethical dilemmas of the media covering elections in a way that is more in-tune with a sporting event are already widely discussed and recognized. This year’s general election is different from years’ past, with the top two Republican candidates so far, Donald Trump and Ben Carson, coming from no political background. “I agree there has been a lot of emphasis on what might seem like a sporting event, but also it’s so unusual trying to understand the electorate by looking at these polls. It’s not just a horse race, but that’s kind of what’s going on here,” said Fox. Despite the ethical dilemmas previously discussed, why does the media continue to cover elections in this manner? Media as a watchdog, and as a means make sure there is a well-informed electorate, or public educator, is harder now in the digital age. Does the coverage of elections in the sporting-event manner play into the larger role of journalism as a public educator? Or is it just a way to fuel the business side and make revenue for organizations and advertisers?</p>

            <p>There is no denying that ratings are a large reason of why the media covers elections the way they do. “One of the things that I talk about in my class, this is not something I make up this is something people do research on and understand in political science, the media is a business first and foremost,” Fraga said. With the shift into the internet culture we live in today, information is much more readily available for citizens, the role of the traditional media as gatekeepers of information is quickly changing. As a business model, traditional media has been losing for a while. Budget cuts and layoffs have become common in large media organizations, and they are struggling to remain relevant in the face of new online companies, such as <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com" target="blank">Buzzfeed</a>. Media organizations are doing their best to find new ways to remain relevant, which is why we see the rise of clickbait headlines, news organizations utilizing social media and other methods to compete with blogs and aggregate sites for views and clicks.</p>

          <div class="seven columns text">
            <p>The broadcast coverage of the elections has reflected this too — for example, during the Republican debate, even when Trump wasn’t answering on screen, he would be on a split-screen so the audience could see his reactions. “To my knowledge, Trump hasn’t spent a dime on advertising yet. He may have since spent something, but why should he? He is getting all the attention,” Fox said. “It was like, for the ratings we must have Trump on screen all times. If Trump isn’t on screen, people will change the channel.” The increased interest around this year’s general elections can be tied to Trump — people are waiting to see what he will do next, and his sustained lead on the polls proves that it wasn’t a “flash in the pan” phenomenon, Fox said.</p>
            
            <p>On one hand, covering elections in this way — in terms of a winner and a loser, with emphasis placed on debates, turning them into a “sport” — could be helpful to the electorate. It’s no secret that sports are popular in America. In 2012, the live election coverage on NBC, the most-watched network, <a href="http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/11/07/nbc-news-tops-all-tv-networks-for-2012-election-night-coverage/156606/" target="_blank">drew 12.122 million viewers</a> from 8 to 11 p.m. in November. By contrast, that same year in February the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/07/super-bowl-2012-tv-ratings-record" target="_blank">Super Bowl drew an average of 111.3 million viewers</a>. It’s clear people love sports, but the difference in these numbers is astounding. One is a yearly sporting event, and one is the coverage to find out who the leader of our country will be for the next four years. Despite which one would seem more important based on these ideas, the Super Bowl had nearly ten times as many viewers.</p>

            <p>From this thinking, it isn’t crazy to think that covering elections like a sporting event may be helpful in informing the electorate, because despite the ethical dilemmas which arise, it seems more interesting and can gather more viewers to pay attention to what is happening in their country’s political environment. But trying to simplify politics into the box that sporting events fit into can cause many problems. For example, it is easy to contrast different candidates against each other when it is a democrat versus a republican. It is less easy, however, in this general election race we are witnessing right now with the Republican field. “The media’s routine of being objective is to present two sides to a story — as if there are two, and only two, sides of a story — and that’s easy when it's a general election and you have two candidates and you can do soundbite, soundbite, done. When you have fifteen candidates and they are all on the same party, but they have differences, now you have to really look for subtleties,” said Fox.</p>
           
            <p>One the media’s primary roles, in order to keep a healthy democracy, is to work as an educator of the electorate. To do this, the media first has to gain their attention. Covering the elections in a more “entertaining” way is one way to achieve this, and one that on the surface doesn’t have any negative implications. However, if the media can’t adapt to the complexities presented in different races, like the Republican field currently happening, then it can’t cover the election in a fair way, and fails as a public educator.</p>

            <p>In this assignment, we aimed to look at the way the media covers presidential elections in our country and the ethical dilemmas that arise from this coverage. We figured we would speak to experts on the topic while also gathering information from studies and scholarly articles. Of course, we also had to keep in mind the requirement of primary sources.<sup class="bold">1</sup> Primary sources are important because they allow us to look at data and information without it being filtered through someone else's eyes. In this way, primary sources are typically free of bias (as we have learned from News-Decoder, we all have our biases and, although that isn't a bad thing, in this case it is not helpful). To have primary sources means that we have gone to the original content and made a judgment on our own about the implications of that information.</p>

            <p>Once we gathered our primary sources, which consisted mainly of our interviews and some polling data, we also had to consider the biases we were introducing into our writing and if they were valid ones.<sup class="bold">2</sup> For example, in both of our separate analyses, we consider electing the leader of the country to be one of the most important responsibilities a citizen could hold. We feel this was a fair view to insert in there due to the impact a presidential election can have in the future of our country, and the fact that the right to vote has been such a privilege since the birth of this country. However , other people may not place as much of an emphasis on the importance of voting as we do in this paper. Actually, since the <a href ="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/opinion/the-worst-voter-turnout-in-72-years.html?_r=0" target="_blank">2014 midterm elections had the worst voter turnout since World War II</a>, it is not a ridiculous assumption to think other people may not take the responsibility of voting as seriously as we assumed our audience would. Despite this, our bias about our audience is still a fair one, due to the historical importance of voting in the United States. </p>

Fraga is currently teaching a course titled "Voting, Election, and Public Opinion" in the Political Science department, which we thought would bring us insight on voter behavior and the way elections work. Though Fraga doesn't directly study the media, he teaches it in his class. We had to be conscious about the claims they made; both of them referenced studies but didn't exactly cite them since they couldn't remember.<sup class="bold">4</sup> So, we had to go search for this information ourselves to see if we could supplement it with any other primary sources found online.</p>
